                            time. At the incredible speed of now.</p>

                        <p>We are a tech company that connects the physical and digital worlds to help make movement
                            happen
                            at the tap of a button. Because we believe in a world where movement should be accessible.
                            So
                            you can move and earn safely. In a way that’s sustainable for our planet. And regardless of
                            your
                            gender, race, religion, abilities, or sexual orientation, we champion your right to move and
                            earn freely and without fear. Of course, we haven’t always gotten it right. But we’re not
                            afraid
                            of failure, because it makes us better, wiser, and stronger. And it makes us even more
                            committed
                            to do the right thing by our customers, local communities and cities, and our incredibly
                            diverse
                            set of international partners.</p>

                        <p>The idea for Uber was born on a snowy night in Paris in 2008, and ever since then our DNA of
                            reimagination and reinvention carries on. We’ve grown into a global platform powering
                            flexible
                            earnings and the movement of people and things in ever expanding ways. We’ve gone from
                            connecting rides on 4 wheels to 2 wheels to 18-wheel freight deliveries. From takeout meals
                            to
                            daily essentials to prescription drugs to just about anything you need at any time and
                            earning
                            your way. From drivers with background checks to real-time verification, safety is a top
                            priority every single day. At Uber, the pursuit of reimagination is never finished, never
                            stops,
                            and is always just beginning.</p>
